    Conformer generation is based on four-spatial dimension Distance Geometry. This
    library's implementation features the following:

    1. A spatial model generates atom-pairwise bounds on their distance in the final
       conformations and four-atom chiral constraints when distance bounds cannot
       encompass chiral elements of complex shapes. For large shapes, chiral
       information is captured by using multiple chiral constraints.
    2. The distance bounds are smoothed to conform to the triangle inequalities.
       After each successive choice of a fixed distance between the bounds, you can
       choose to re-smooth all bounds (full metrization) or stop re-smoothing after
       a fixed number of chosen distances (partial metrization).
    3. The bounds are embedded in four dimensions and refined in three stages,
       permitting the chiral constraints to invert by expanding into four
       dimensions, and then compressing the fourth dimension back out. Lastly,
       dihedral error terms are minimized.
    4. The refinement error function is modified to enable the placement of haptic
       ligand's bonding atoms' average position at shapes' idealized ligand
       sites.
