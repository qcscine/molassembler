      Helper type for directed conformer generation.

      Generates new combinations of BondStereopermutator assignments
      and provides helper functions for the generation of conformers using these
      combinations and the reverse, finding the combinations from conformers.

      It is important that you lower your expectations for the modeling of
      dihedral energy minima, however. Considering that Molassembler neither
      requires you to supply a correct graph, never detects or kekulizes
      aromatic systems nor asks you to supply an overall charge for a molecule,
      it should be understandable that the manner in which Molassembler decides
      where dihedral energy minima are is somewhat underpowered. The manner in
      which shape vertices are aligned in stereopermutation enumeration isn't
      even strictly based on a physical principle. We suggest the following to
      make the most of what the library can do for you:

      - Read the documentation for the various alignments. Consider using not
        just the default
        :class:`~scine_molassembler.BondStereopermutator.Alignment.Staggered`
        alignment, but either
        :class:`~scine_molassembler.BondStereopermutator.Alignemnt.EclipsedAndStaggered`
        or
        :class:`~scine_molassembler.BondStereopermutator.Alignment.BetweenEclipsedAndStaggered`
        to improve your chances of capturing all rotational minima. This will
        likely generate more conformers than strictly required, but should
        capture all minima.
      - Energy minimize all generated conformers with a suitable method and
        then deduplicate.
      - Consider using the
        :class:`~scine_molassembler.DirectedConformerGenerator.Relabeler` to do
        a final deduplication step.
