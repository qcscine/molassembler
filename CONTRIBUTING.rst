Code style
-----------

Molassembler follows SCINE code style conventions.

signed vs unsigned
..................

Molassembler prefers unsigned integers for container element indices (follow
STL style).

- Generally prefer range-for over indexed access
- Iterator differences return signed types

Ideally, container element indices should be ``std::size_t`` and its iterator
differences should be ``std::ptrdiff_t`` if they are expected to be able to
contain large amounts of values.

Any integers where subtracting is expected should be signed. If unsigned values
are used in subtractions, ``static_cast`` them beforehand!

C++ style
.........

Try to follow the C++ Core Guidelines.

Formatting
..........

Unenforced, follows my own idiosyncratic formatting style that I think
clang-format doesn't support. I try to keep the code 80-char wide.
