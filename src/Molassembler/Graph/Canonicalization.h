 * Graph canonicalization is an algorithm that generates an isomorphic graph
 * to its input. The important property is that the algorithm's output graph is
 * identical for all graphs that are isomorphic to its input. For two canonical
 * graphs, an isomorphism test reduces to a fast identity test.
 *
 * Naturally, graph canonicalization is computationally at least as hard as an
 * isomorphism test on non-canonical graphs, so little time (if any) is saved
 * by canonicalizing two molecules separately, then using the identity
 * comparison. However, it is worth canonicalizing molecules when it is to be
 * expected that repeated isomorphism computations need to be performed upon
 * many molecules. For instance, checking whether a molecule is already present
 * in a set of molecules can be sped up considerably.
