/**
 * @brief Type that will own rvalues, reference lvalues
 *
 * @tparam T Type to conditionally bind
 *
 * In some situations, templated arguments need to be owned by the recipient.
 * For instance, if you want to create a new range from some container, the
 * handling of whether the container being modified is owned by the new range
 * is very important to avoid both extraneous copies and dangling references.
 *
 * We have to differentiate between rvalue and lvalue reference arguments to
 * the adaptor constructor. Any rvalues have to be owned by the range being
 * constructed, while any lvalues should be bound to a (const) reference.
 *
 * This class makes handling that stuff a little easier by providing a single
 * constructor that takes care of all cases.
 *
 * You can also just use this class as a metafunction (see type).
