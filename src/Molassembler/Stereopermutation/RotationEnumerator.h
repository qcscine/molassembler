 *
 * Construction of class creates the first stereopermutation, repeated calls
 * to @p next generate successive rotations.
 *
 * Idea behind the algorithm and data structure is that starting from any
 * structure, we apply a rotation. If the result is new, we add it as a link in
 * a chain of structures. If the result has already been discovered, we try
 * again, but with a different rotation.
 *
 * Having written that down, it's probably not too difficult to rewrite this
 * into a recursive solution. This is more of a backtracking algorithm.
