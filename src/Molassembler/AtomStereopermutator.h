/**
 * @brief Handles the steric permutation of substituents of a non-terminal
 *   central atom
 *
 * This class handles the permutation of ranked ligands around a central atom.
 * It models its haptic ligands' binding sites and bridges in multidentate
 * ligands in order to decide which stereopermutations are feasible. A
 * stereopermutation may be infeasible, i.e. not realizable in
 * three-dimensional space, if either haptic ligands would intersect due to
 * too close ligand angles for their spatial heft, or if a multidentate
 * ligand's bridge length between binding sites were too short to match the
 * angle. The list of stereopermutations reduced by infeasible
 * stereopermutations is then re-indexed and those indices into the list are
 * called assignments.
 *
 * A Stereopermutator can be unassigned, i.e. the distinct stereopermutation
 * that the substituents are can be indeterminate. If you choose to generate
 * conformers for a molecule that includes unassigned stereopermutators, every
 * conformer will choose an assignment from the pool of feasible assignments
 * randomly, but consistent with relative statistical occurrence weights.
 *
 * E.g. a square planar AABC ligand set will have an A-A cis stereopermutation
 * that occurs twice as often as the A-A trans stereopermutation.
 *
 * @note An instance of this class on a given central atom does not indicate
 *   that that atom is a stereocenter. That is only the case if there are
 *   multiple stereopermutations of the ranked substituents / ligands.
